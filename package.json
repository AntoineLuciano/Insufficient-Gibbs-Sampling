  "description": "The InsufficientGibbs package offers functionalities for sampling from posterior parameters when only robust and insufficient statistics of the data are available. A comprehensive explanation of the underlying theory can be found in the associated paper on arXiv (\\url{link}{https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14973}). Additionally, the code responsible for generating all figures presented in the paper is located in the Figures folder.",
